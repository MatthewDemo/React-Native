React Native test task

Here I made simple App, where you can see characters from Star Wars.

You can load more characters by pushing "Show more" button.
If you like some characters, you can tap "heart" button on the right side of the card. 
Then you can see the list of characters you liked by tapping "Favorites" button on the right top of the main page. Also you can see the genders of persons you've liked.
If you want clear your "favorites", you can tap "Reset" button on the left top of the main page.
If you want to get more information about person - you can tap on the card and you'll be redirected to page, with detail information about this person.
